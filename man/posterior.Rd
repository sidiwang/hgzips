\item{grid_omega}{omega value grid}

\item{pi_klh_final_omega_j}{final estimation of the probability of each omega value (HZINB, assuming a_j, b_j and omega_j are independent from each other), produced by the EM algorithm (use pi_klh_final_omega_j = NULL if it's an independent case)}

\item{N_ij}{matrix of N_ij, i = AE, j = drugs}

\item{E_ij}{matrix of E_ij, i = AE, j = drugs}

\item{zeroes}{A logical scalar specifying if zero counts should be included.}

\item{N_star}{the minimum Nij count size to be used for hyperparameter estimation. If zeroes are included in Nij vector, please set N_star = NULL}

\item{grid_a}{alpha value grid}

\item{grid_b}{beta value grid}

\item{pi_klh_final_a_j}{final estimation of the probability of each alpha value (HZINB, assuming a_j, b_j and omega_j are independent from each other), produced by the EM algorithm (use pi_klh_final_a_j = NULL if it's an independent case)}

\item{pi_klh_final_b_j}{final estimation of the probability of each beta value (HZINB, assuming a_j, b_j and omega_j are independent from each other), produced by the EM algorithm (use pi_klh_final_b_j = NULL if it's an independent case)}

\item{pi_klh}{final estimation of the probability of each a_j - b_j - omega_j combination (HZINB, not assuming independence), produced by the EM algorithm (use pi_klh = NULL if it's an independent case)}

\item{dataset}{a list of squashed datasets that include N_ij, E_ij and weights for each drug (j). This dataset list can be generated by the rawProcessing function in this package. (use dataset = NULL if it's an unsquashed case)}
